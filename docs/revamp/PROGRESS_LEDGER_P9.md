# Revamp Progress Ledger -- P-RC-9 (orgs/ integral migration)

<!-- machine-readable phase marker; do NOT remove.
     Parsed by tests/revamp/_ledger.py + tests/parity/test_no_facade.py. -->
current_phase: P-RC-9

> Source of truth for every commit landed on ``revamp/v3-orgs``
> during the P-RC-9 ``src/openakita/orgs/`` integral migration.
> One row per commit, in commit order. Each row is appended *in
> the same commit that produced it* (N3 from G-RC-1).
>
> This ledger is **separate** from ``docs/revamp/PROGRESS_LEDGER.md``
> (which is frozen at P-RC-8 close). Keeping P-RC-9 in its own file
> stops the long P-RC-0..8 history from being mixed with the new
> 30-50 commits the charter projects, and lets future readers diff
> the two phases cleanly.
>
> Rules of the ledger (per continuation plan ?0.3, inherited):
> * append-only -- once a row lands on ``revamp/v3-orgs`` it must
>   not be silently rewritten;
> * ``LOC delta`` and ``tests delta`` are signed integers,
>   positive = grew, negative = shrank, ``0`` = unchanged;
> * ``ADR refs`` lists the ADRs whose sections the commit
>   implements (ADR-0011/0012/0013 are P-RC-9-specific).
>
> Pause points: every 5 commits, re-read
> ``docs/revamp/P-RC-9-PLAN.md`` + this ledger + the relevant
> phase section before opening the next commit.
